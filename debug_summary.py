Your code has been modified to process files individually instead of in batches.

BEFORE (Original Behavior):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Load ALL files from directory                           │
│ 2. Try to upload ALL files to database                     │
│ 3. If ANY file fails, ENTIRE batch fails                   │
│ 4. If batch fails, NO files get moved                      │
│ 5. If batch succeeds, ALL files get moved                  │

AFTER (New Behavior):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Load ALL files from directory                           │
│ 2. Group documents by filename                             │
│ 3. For EACH file individually:                             │
│    a. Try to upload to database                            │
│    b. If successful: upload to storage + move file         │
│    c. If failed: leave file in source, continue next       │
│ 4. Report success/failure for each file                    │

SUCCESSFUL FILES (moved to processed folder):

✅ Duplicate files don't block new files
✅ You can easily see which files need attention
✅ Failed files can be retried or removed manually

1. RUN YOUR UPLOAD PROCESS:
   python upload_supa_chroma.py
   
2. CHECK THE OUTPUT:
   - Look for "✓ Successfully processed and moved" messages
   - Look for "✗ Error processing" messages
   - Note which files failed and why

3. HANDLE FAILED FILES:
   - For duplicates: Delete from kb_new/ if you don't need them
   - For errors: Fix the issue and retry
   - Files in kb_new/ can be processed again safely

4. VERIFY RESULTS:
   - Check kb_new/ for remaining files (these failed)
   - Check kb/ for moved files (these succeeded)
   - Your database will have the successful files

5. RERUN AS NEEDED:
   - You can run the process again
   - Only remaining files in kb_new/ will be processed
   - Already processed files won't be affected

Introduction 
This competitive analysis aims to identify opportunities for a new financial tracking app, 
Efter, by examining the strengths and weaknesses of existing direct competitors. In addition, 
we will look outside of financial domain — areas like mindfulness, habit-building and 
behavioral change. 
Based on the Problem analysis document, we concluded that the app will sit at the 
intersection of: 
• Financial tracking 
• Behavioral change 
• Well-being/Mindfulness

Comparison Matrix

matter, the judgement is subjective.

Based on the Comparison Matrix, we can conclude the following: 
Beginner-friendliness: 3 out of 5 apps have a moderate learning curve, while the other 2 
have moderate to shallow.  
User-friendliness: Despite having varying learning curves, all applications are intuitive and 
easy to navigate. The difference in the ease of use is mainly dictated by the purpose of the 
app (budgeting, investment, etc.). 
Budgeting-focused: Our application will use budgeting as one of its primary tools to affect 
behavior. Some apps showed a great emphasis on using this technique, while others 
prioritize a more holistic approach and investments. 
Bank Integration: All apps support Bank integration. However, at EveryDollar you only get it 
with a paid subscription, otherwise the transaction input is manual. This criterion will be 
crucial when building an app that targets emotional spendings. 
Financial-health-focused: For our application, we will need to look at daily spending habits. 
Some apps are good at providing a whole picture, but they don’t directly address the 
underlying emotional triggers of spending. 
Price Policy: This criterion is neutral, not contributing to the overall effectiveness of the tool. 
However, it is work mentioning that for EveryDollar the transaction input is manual, unless a 
subscription is acquired. 
The listed competitors might excel in other areas that I didn’t mention in this analysis. 
However, these are the most important goals to achieve when creating Efter.

Conclusion 
To summarize, we discussed the different advantages our competitors offer, as well as 
some areas that they do not cover. Those areas (Financial Health, Behavioral Change, 
Beginner-friendliness) we will target with the creation of Efter. Additionally, techniques from 
mindfulness and habit-building domains will be adopted.
